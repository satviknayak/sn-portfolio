  My Portfolio

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Fork the repository to your profile and clone it.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/satviknayak/portfolio
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `portfolio` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
